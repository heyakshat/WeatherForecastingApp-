Weather-Forecasting-App
With the help of the Tkinter framework, the accompanying Python code illustrates a simple weather forecasting app. When a user enters the name of a city into the app's input field and clicks the "Search Weather" button, the OpenWeatherMap API is used to retrieve and show weather data for the entered city. The current weather condition, temperature in Celsius, humidity level, and wind speed in meters per second are all included in the meteorological information provided.
